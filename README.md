This HTML file w/ embedded Java Script accepts JSON messages from a Python script and
parses those messages in order to update a particular element.  

This acts similar to the Java and C# clients; but, is not nearly as performant, although
this does offer a level of expanded access options.

This is Proof of Concept alpha code in that a core feature is currently missing and 
that is the ability to make changes to EEPROM settings on the board.  The 'issues'
related to this are detailed in the html document itself.
